Due 10:00pm, Sunday, February 12

In this lab you will be writing a number of short programs to get some
practice working with Java. After this lab, you should be able to:
- write code in Java;
- read in command line arguments; and
- use `Scanner` to be able to do input from users and files.

Let's get this programming party started! Unlike most of the other labs, this one will consist of a number of small programming assignments to give you a chance to become familiar with programming in Java.

You will create the following Java files for this lab:
- `Pyramid.java`
- `HiLo.java`
- `EvalAnalysis.java`

We will provide you with the following data files:
- `sample.prn`
- `tae.prn`
