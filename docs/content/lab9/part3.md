### Example from _As you Like It_

```
    [Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,
    like foresters]

DUKE SENIOR    Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
    Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
    Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
    More free from peril than the envious court?
    Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
    The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
    And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
    Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
    Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
    'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
    That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
    Sweet are the uses of adversity,
    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
    And this our life exempt from public haunt
    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
    Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
    I would not change it.

AMIENS    Happy is your grace,
    That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
    Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

DUKE SENIOR    Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
    And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
    Being native burghers of this desert city,
    Should in their own confines with forked heads
    Have their round haunches gored.

### Example from random Shakespeare with order 6 model

```
DUKE SENIOR    Now, my co-mates and thus bolden'd, man, how now, monsieur Jaques,
    Unclaim'd of his absence, as the holly!
    Though in the slightest for the fashion of his absence, as the only wear.

TOUCHSTONE    I care not for meed!
    This I must woo yours: your request than your father: the time,
    That ever love I broke
    my sword upon some kind of men
    Then, heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the needless stream;
    'Poor deer,' quoth he,
    'Call me not so keen,
    Because thou the creeping hours of the sun,
    As man's feasts and women merely players:
    Thus we may rest ourselves and neglect the cottage, pasture?

    [Exit]

    [Enter DUKE FREDERICK    Can in his time in my heartily,
    And have me go with your fortune
    In all this fruit
    Till than bear
    the arm's end: I will through
    Cleanse the uses of the way to look you.
    Know you not, master,
    Sighing like upon a stone another down his bravery is not so with his effigies with my food:
    To speak my mind, and inquisition
    And unregarded age in corners throat,
    He will come hither:
    He dies that hath engender'd:
    And you to
    the bed untreasured of the brutish sting it.

### Example from _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ using order 12 model

```
In every generation there is a Chosen One. She alone will stand against 
the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer.

The Bronze at night. Cut inside. The camera follows her out.

Cordelia:  Well, just one dance.

They dance close.

Owen:  It's weird.

Buffy:  I know.

A vampire brings the demons, which ends 
the world.

Willow:  Angel stopped by? Wow. Was there... Well, I mean, was it having 
to do with kissing?

Buffy:  Mom! Mom, can you hear me? / Can you see me? / What's inside of me? /
Oh, I just wanted to start over. Be like everybody else. Have some friends,
y'know, maybe three isn't company anymore.

Buffy:  Why are you following me? I just had this feeling 
she'd do just about enough!

Buffy shoots Xander a look.

Snyder:  I don't know. Where do you know about this close to expulsion, and just 
the faintest aroma of jail.

Giles:  (to Buffy) Well, he is young.

Buffy:  It shouldn't be. (starts back to their original form, which is, uh, uh,
slightly l
