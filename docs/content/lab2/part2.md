## Part 2 -- Fighting Squirrels

In this part of the lab, you will extend an abstract class.  We have provided
you with an abstract class, `Fighter`, and the code for a fighting game, called
`FightDriver.java`.  If you look at `Fighter.java`, you will see it has three
methods that have already been written for you, and three methods you will
have to write yourself in any code that inherits from this class.  You will
have to write the following methods:

`public int fight()`
: This should return a constant representing a possible
  fighting move.  You can see that at the top of the `Fighter` class, we have
  defined four constants: `BLOCK`, `PUNCH`, `KICK` and `FIREBALL`.  In order
  for the `FightDriver` code to work correctly, you will need to return one of
  these constants.

  A note about strategy:  Each type of fight move has an integer value
  associated with it.  The move takes that much energy from the fighter who
  uses the move, and does twice that much damage to the fighter the move is
  used on---if it doesn't miss.  Fighters start with 50 energy, and get 15 more
  energy each round.  If a player has negative energy they are too tired to
  continue and lose the fight.

`public String name()`
: This should return the name of the fighter.

`public String winning()`
: This returns the catchphrase the fighter says when they win.

`public String losing()`
:  This returns the catchphrase the fighter says when they lose.
{: .implement-box}

You will create the following fighter classes, each of which extend the
abstract class `Fighter`.

`Pyro`
: - Fight: If `Pyro`â€™s energy is above 30, they use the `FIREBALL` move.  Otherwise they `BLOCK`. 
  - Name: `Pyro`
  - Winning & Losing: You can come up with some appropriate fire related
    catchphrases, or use the ones from the examples below.  

`KickyPunchy`
: - Fight: `KickyPunchy` alternates between `KICK` and `PUNCH`.
  - Name: `KickyPunchy`
  - Winning & Losing: You can come up with some appropriate catchphrases, or
    use the ones from the examples below.  

`FightingSquirrel`
: You get to design this one! Come up with whatever strategy, name, and catchphrases you like.

### Testing your code

If you implemented everything correctly, when you compile everything and run
the `FightDriver code`, everything should work. The fight outcomes are random,
but you should get something like this
