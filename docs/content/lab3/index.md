In this lab, you will create your first implementation of a data structure
from the Java Collections Framework. You will also learn how to use Generics
and get some practice writing test cases for you program.  After this lab you should be able to:
- use the Java Collections Framework;
- create a class using generics;
- use an abstract class to jumpstart an implementation; and
- use JUnit to do proper testing.

You will need to create the following files:
- `MyArrayList.java`
- `MyArrayListTest.java` (the JUnit tests for `MyArrayList`)

Let's get started with a [warmup](warmup.html)!
