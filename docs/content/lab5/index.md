# Lab 5 -- Link 'em up!

* Lab 5 Home
* [Warmup](warmup.html)
* [Part 1](part1.html)
* [Part 2](part2.html)
* [Part 3](part3.html)
* [Submission](submission.html)

Due before 10pm, Friday, March 17th

In this lab you will implement a doubly linked list and perform some timing experiments on it.

After this lab you will be able to:
- implement a doubly linked list;
- build an iterator; and
- explore the differences in running time between different data structures.

If you'd like, you may work with one partner on this lab. If you choose to do
so, you must both contribute equally to the work of this lab, and are both
responsible for understanding its workings. You can then hand in one
submission between the two of you, with both your names clearly marked
somewhere obvious to the graders (e.g., `README` and headers of all files).

We provide you with the following Java files that you will *not* need to change:
- `IterationTester.java`

You will create the following Java files:
- `MyLinkedList.java` 
- `MyLinkedListTest.java`

I have some starting point code for you here: [Lab5.zip](Lab5.zip).
It contains a directory of text files you will use for testing.
