## Submission

Look through your Java files and make sure you've included your name at the
top of all of them.

The contents of the `README` file should include the following:
- Your name
- Any known problems or assumptions made in your classes or program

If you adhered to the honor code in this assignment, add the following
statement to your `README` file:
> I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.

Quit Eclipse, and then delete the `bin` directory.
(If you don't quit Eclipse first, it will keep regenerating your class
files when it autocompiles!)

Zip the `Lab7` directory and turn it in via Blackboard.
