## Part 1 - Getting started


### Lab access, computer accounts
<p>
    If you weren't registered for a CS class at the start of the semester, you
    will need to go and see <a href="mailto:Jackie.Fortino@oberlin.edu">Jackie Fortino</a>
    in King 223 about getting building access for
    the semester.  You should do this now, before you forget!
</p>

<p>
    If you don't have a CS account and didn't sign up on the list during
    the first day of class, see <a href="mailto:chris.mohler@oberlin.edu">Chris Mohler</a>
    in the OCTET office (King 125) about getting one.
</p>

<p>
    Go to one of the CS computer labs and log in to a computer.  The labs are in
    King 201 and King 135.  You should have gotten the door code from your CS
    professor on the first day of class.
    For the most part we will use room 201 unless the class becomes too large.
