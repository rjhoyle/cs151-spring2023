## Submission

Look through your source files and be sure you've included you name at the top of all of them. If there are any known problems or incomplete features, document that also at the top of the file. If you adhered to the honor code in this assignment, add the following statement as a comment at the top of your main java file.

<blockquote class="honor">
<p class="centered">
<q class="honor">I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.</q>
</p>
</blockquote>

You now just need to electronically handin all your files.  Quit Eclipse
and delete the class files.  (Otherwise those will be handed in as well!)

Now compress and archive your Lab 0 directory.  On Windows, you can right click on the folder and there should be a command like "Compress to ZIP File".  On a Mac, it'll be called "Compress".  On Linux, you can do it on the terminal:

* ``cd cs151``
* ``tar -xvzf lab0.tgz lab0``

and that will create a file called "lab0.tgz" in your cs151 directory.

You will then need to open a web browser, navigate to Blackboard, and submit the assignment there.

    That's it! You've completed your zeroeth lab. Be sure to logout when you
    are done (icon is to the left of the terminal and globe icons).
