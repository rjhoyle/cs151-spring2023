<h3>handin</h3>
<p>
    You now just need to electronically handin all your files.  Quit Eclipse
    and delete the class files.  (Otherwise those will be handed in as well!)
</p>

<pre class="boxed">
% <span class="typed">cd</span>          # changes to your home directory
% <span class="typed">cd cs151</span>    # goes to your cs151 folder
% <span class="typed">handin</span>      # starts the handin program
                        # class is <span class="typed">151</span>
                        # assignment is <span class="typed">0</span>
                        # file/directory is <span class="typed">lab0</span>

% <span class="typed">lshand</span>      # should show that you've handed in something
</pre>

<p>
    You can also specify the options to handin from the command line
</p>

<pre class="boxed">
% <span class="typed">cd ~/cs151</span>                 # goes to your cs151 folder
% <span class="typed">handin -c 151 -a 0 lab0</span>
</pre>

<p>
    That's it! You've completed your zeroeth lab. Be sure to logout when you
    are done (icon is to the left of the terminal and globe icons).
