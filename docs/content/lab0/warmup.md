## Warmup! - Access


### Lab access, computer accounts
<p>
    If you weren't registered for a CS class at the start of the semester, you
    will need to go and see <a href="mailto:Jackie.Fortino@oberlin.edu">Jackie Fortino</a>
    in King 139 about getting building access for
    the semester.  You should do this now, before you forget!
</p>

If you don't have an OCCS account and weren't signed up for the first day of class email [support@oberlin.edu](mailto:support@oberlin.edu) and ask them for an OCCS account.  You will need this to use the Linux environment on the lab machines.  You do not need one if you just want to use your own machine or use the Windows environment.  If you pursue Computer Science, you will definitely need an account for CSCI 241, so you might as well get one now and start playing with Linux.

<p>
    Go to one of the CS computer labs and log in to a computer.  The labs are in
    King 201 and King 135.  You should have gotten the door code from your CS
    professor on the first day of class.
    For the most part we will use room 135 this semester, though both are available.
</p>

### Setting up your own machine

If you would like to use your own computer for development, you will need to install the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).  These are built for pretty much all major systems these days, so you should pick the appropriate system/architecture for your machine.  If you are using a new Mac, remember that they use the AArch64 architecture, and not the x86_64 architecture.  Older Macs will use x86.

You may need to install a JDK along with your Eclipse installation.  You can find the official Oracle Java one at [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).  You may also find open JDK implementations in various places, such as [https://adoptium.net/](https://adoptium.net/).

If you are just going to use a lab machine, you can skip this step.

### Setting up class tools

#### Clicker
<p>
  We will be using iClickers for class participation.  If you have not
  previously registered your iclicker, you need to go to the Blackboard page for this class and register your clicker.  Do so, and bring it to class on Monday.
</p>

#### Google Form

Now that you're familiar with the lab, I'd like you to share some info with
me.  Please fill out [this Google form](https://forms.gle/MyYibio6tXFEt4k49).  This will also be used to assign your discussion group.


#### Piazza

Enroll in the <a href="https://piazza.com/oberlin/spring2023/csci151">Piazza</a> forums that we will be using for classroom discussion.  Questions about the lectures or labs should be posted here.  We will be monitoring them and answering questions as we see them.  You can post anonymously to other students, if you prefer.

At this point, post a message introducing yourself.  Include a picture, hobbies, year, etc.  Basically, let us know you a bit better.  Why are you taking this class?  What are you hoping to get out of it?  Do you have cute pictures of your pets?
