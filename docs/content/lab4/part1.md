## Part 1 -- Stacks and Queues
We've been talking about stacks and queues in class, and now it is your time
to put that theory to good use. Write two classes `MyStack<T>` and `MyQueue<T>`
that implement the supplied interfaces `StackADT` and `QueueADT`, respectively.

`MyStack`
: An implementation of the provided `StackADT` interface that is capable
  of storing an arbitrarily large amount of data. Use an `ArrayList` for storage.

`MyQueue`
: An implementation of the provided `QueueADT` interface that is
  capable of storing an arbitrarily large amount of data.  You will implement
  the `QueueADT` as a linked structure, as described in the worksheet.

Before continuing, you should add JUnit tests for `MyStack` and `MyQueue` that
perform testing on your data structures. Call these `MyStackTest` and
`MyQueueTest`.
