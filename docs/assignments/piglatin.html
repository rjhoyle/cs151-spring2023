        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            For this assignment create a program <tt>pig</tt> that will read in
            English text and translate it into Pig Latin. In particular you'll
            be working with strings in C.

        <div class="textbox">
            I'm interested in seeing how much time students estimate an
            assignment will take versus how much time they actually spend on
            the assignment. What I'd like you to do is read through this
            assignment and create a README with your estimated time to
            complete it. (Feel free to list time for individual components
            as well if you'd like.) After you get done, I'd like you to add
            in the actual amount of time you spent.
        </div>

        <h2>Programming Details</h2>
        <p>
            Pig Latin is used by both adults and children to obfuscate what they
            are saying from the other. Some of you might have toyed around with
            the language yourself as a child.
        </p>

        <h3>Translating Pig Latin</h3>
        <p>
            For this assignment, you'll be creating a programs <tt>pig</tt>. <tt>pig</tt> will read in English text and
            convert it into pig latin. 
				</p>
        
        <h3>Pig Latin Translation Rules</h3>
        <p>
             There are a couple of varying
            rules to Pig Latin. For this assignment, we'll be using the
            following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p class="thick">Rule 1:</p> If the string begins with a vowel
                (that is begins with 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u') add "yay" to
                the end of the string.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="thick">Rule 2:</p> Otherwise, find the first occurance
                of a vowel, then move all the letters before the vowel to the
                end of the word and add "ay". <p class="thick">Note:</p> "y"
                should be considered a vowel in this context.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            You can consider a word to be a consecutive sequence of letters
            (A-Z, a-z). "y" should be treated as a consonant if it is the first
            letter of the word but as a vowel otherwise.
        </p>

        <h3>Punctuation &amp; Grammar</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to modifying the words as specified above, your program
            should also respect the following rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Puntuation in sentences should be preserved (periods, commas
                whitespace, tabs, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Capitalization should be preserved. The original capital letter
                should be lowercased and the new initial letter should be
                capitalized. So, Linux would become Inuxlay.
            </li>
            <li>
                The letter pair "qu" together should be treated as a consonant,
                rather than a single character.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hypenated words should be treated as two words.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Some dialects of pig latin say that you should move "silent" letters
            to the end as well (such as in the word knife). You can ignore
            contraction words (don't).
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>
            In general, the words will be translated as follows:</br>
            Linux -> Inuxlay</br>
</br>
            yes -> esyay</br>
            example -> exampleyay</br>
        </p>

        <h2>Programming Notes</h2>
        <p>
            Some guidelines you should follow when working on your solution:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                No word we use in our testing will be longer than 100
                characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>strcpy</tt>, <tt>strcat</tt>, <tt>strdup</tt> are useful
                functions for this assignment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You'll want to think about how to breaks this program into its
            component parts.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Command line arguments</h2>
        <p>
            Additionally, I'd like you to implement a <tt>-h</tt> and
            <tt>-?</tt> flag that prints out a brief usage message and exits the
            program with a non-zero value. You should do the same if an
            unknown flag is passed to the program.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should have your program's main function return 0 upon
            successful completion of the assigned task.
        </p>


<!--- 
><hr>
<h2>Man page</h2>
<p>
    You'll also be creating a man page to accompany your tool.  Man pages are
    simply text files that have some additional annotations with formatting
    instructions -- somewhat similar to LaTeX if you've encountered that as
    well.
</p>

<p>
    Traditionally, the tool <tt>nroff</tt> was used to do typesetting of man
    pages.  These days, many systems now have <tt>groff</tt> and just have
    nroff as an alias to groff.  You can get more info on the various options by
    seeing the manpage <tt>groff_man(7)</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Important nroff macros to know</h3>
<p>
    At a minimum, you will need to know the following macros (all go at the
    start of the line).
</p>
<dl class="code">

    <dt><tt>.\&quot;</tt>
    <dd>designates a comment line.  There usually is a block of these at the top.

    <dt><tt>.TH 
        <em>&lt;name&gt;</em> 
        <em>&lt;section&gt;</em> 
        <em>&lt;center-footer&gt;</em> 
        <em>&lt;left-footer&gt;</em>  
        <em>&lt;center-header&gt;</em></tt>
    <dd>Title Heading. Use this after the initial
    block of comments at the start. It takes the following 5 arguments:
    <ol class="padded">
        <li><tt>name</tt> - name of the command or function</li>
        <li><tt>section</tt> - section of the manual (1 for user commands)</li>
        <li><tt>center-footer</tt> - date the page was last modified</li>
        <li><tt>left-footer</tt> - use "CSCI 241" for man pages in this class</li>
        <li><tt>center-header</tt> - this is the organization field, use
        "Oberlin College" for this course</li>
    </ol>

    <dt><tt>.SH <em>text</em></tt>
    <dd>A section header.  By convention these
    should be in all caps.  Commonly used values are NAME, SYNOPSIS,
    DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, DIAGNOSTICS, AUTHOR, BUGS in that order. 

    <dt><tt>.SS <em>text</em></tt>
    <dd>A subheading.  By convention these should only have the initial letter caps. 

    <dt><tt>.P</tt>
    <dd>Start a new paragraph.  Each line of the paragraph needs to start in
    column 1.

    <dt><tt>.IP <em>text</em></tt>
    <dd>An indented paragraph.  Very useful for describing options.

    <dt><tt>.B <em>word</em></tt>
    <dd>Bolds the following word

    <dt><tt>.I <em>word</em></tt>
    <dd>Italicizes the following word

<!-- 
    <ol class="padded">
        <li><tt>name</tt> - name of the command or function</li>
        <li><tt>section</tt> - section of the manual (1 for user commands)</li>
        <li><tt>center-footer</tt> - date the page was last modified</li>
        <li><tt>left-footer</tt> - use "CSCI 241" for man pages in this class</li>
        <li><tt>center-header</tt> - this is the organization field, use
        "Oberlin College" for this course</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><tt>.SH <em>text</em></tt> - a section header.  By convention these
    should be in all caps.  Commonly used values are NAME, SYNOPSIS,
    DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, DIAGNOSTICS, AUTHOR, BUGS in that order. </li>

    You should name your file based on the standard convention
    <tt>&lt;name_of_program&gt;.&lt;manual_section&gt;</tt>.  So for the above
    page, it would be <tt>sample_man_page.1</tt>.  (Recall that section 1 is user
    commands.)
</p>

<p>
    To view the processed man page use either of the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>nroff -man sample_man.1 | less -is</tt></li>
    <li><tt>groff -man -Tascii sample_man.1 | less -is</tt></li>

<h2>Extra Credit</h2>

Implement other translations.  Check out <a href="http://www.rinkworks.com/dialect/">http://www.rinkworks.com/dialect/</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jbc/home/chef.html">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jbc/home/chef.html</a> for inspiration.

<h2>Handin</h2>

<h3>README</h3>
<p>
    Create a file called <tt>README</tt> that contains
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your name and a description of the program</li>
    <li>A listing of the files with a short one line description of the contents</li>
    <li>Any known bugs or incomplete functions</li>
    <li>Your estimated time from the start and the actual time taken</li>
    <li>Your affirmation as to the honor code if you followed it</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now you should <tt>make clean</tt> to get rid of your executables and
    handin your folder containing your source files, Makefile, and README through GitHub
</p>

<pre class="boxed">
    % <tt>git add</tt>
    % <tt>git commit</tt>
    % <tt>git push</tt>
</pre>
	    <p>Remember, if you have issues with commits due to odd merges, it is easier to start over, clone into a new directory, and copy the files over before commiting and pushing.
	    </p>
	    <p>In addition, if you are working with a partner, you should do <tt>git pull</tt> periodically to pull their changes into your direction to avoid having to do a merge</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
    Here is what I am looking for in this assignment:
</p>
<ul class="padded">
    <li>A working Makefile with your program, all, and clean as targets</li>

    <li>Appropriately modular code</li>
    
    <li>Good comments</li>

    <li>Programs which run under <tt>valgrind</tt> without errors</li>

    <li>A statement about any valgrind errors which occur and that you could not
    fix</li>

    <li>A README with the information above.  The listing of known bugs is
    important.</li>

</ul>
