<h1>CSCI 241 - Homework 7:<br>Add it up!</h1>
<p>
    <em>Due by 11:59.59pm Monday, May 9</em>

</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    For this assignment, I want you to create a program called <tt>additup</tt>
    that will add up a sequence of positive integers.  One catch, the integers
    can be any number of digits long. 
</p>

<h2>Program behavior</h2>
<p>
    Your program should read in a sequence of integers, one per line using the
    following algorithm.
</p>

<ol class="padded">
    <li>Skip leading whitespace -- you can consider multiple blank lines as
        this, so you are welcome to just use <tt>isspace()</tt> in a while
        loop.</li>

    <li>Skip leading 0's in the number</li>

    <li>Read in the digits from most significant to least significant (i.e.,
    "123" is one hundred twenty-three)</li>

    <li>Once you run out of digits, discard the rest of the line until a newline
        is reached (or EOF)</li>

    <li>If there was no valid integer at the start of a line, you should return
        as if you had read in the value 0.  If you hit EOF without seeing a
        number, you should return NULL.</li>

    <li>Print out the total so far by printing the string "<tt>Total: </tt>"
        with one space and then the total seen so far.</li>

    <li>Once you hit EOF, your program should stop.  Remember that you can signal
        EOF by hitting ctrl-D on your keyboard.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sample run</h2>
<pre class="boxed">
<b>% <span class="typed">./additup</span></b>
       <span class="typed">1234</span> 
Total: 1234
  <span class="typed">9876</span> 
Total: 11110
<span class="typed">1                       bobo</span>
Total: 11111
<span class="typed">1234567890987654321</span>
Total: 1234567890987665432
<span class="typed">^D</span>
</pre>

<p>
    There is also a sample binary (Linux) for you to play with in
    <tt>~rhoyle/pub/cs241/hw7/</tt>
</p>


<h2>Programming details</h2>
<p>
    In order to support arbitrarily long integers, you'll need to represent your
    data in a linked list format.  I'll leave it up to you to decide if you want
    singly or doubly linked lists, but the nodes should look like one of the
    following:
</p>
<pre class="boxed">
<b><u>Singly Linked</u></b>
struct BigInt {
    int digit;
    struct BigInt *next;
};

<b><u>Doubly Linked</u></b>
struct BigInt {
    int digit;
    struct BigInt *next, *prev;
};
</pre>

<p>
    Some things to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul class="padded">
    <li>You should use an <tt>accumulator</tt> to keep track of the sum.  Set
        the value initially to 0 and then keep adding it to the next BigInt.</li>

    <li>Addition takes place from the least significant digit on up.</li>

    <li>You need to be able to handle carrying values from one position to the
        next.  No <tt>digit</tt> value should be greater than 9.</li>

    <li>Printing takes place from the most significant digit on downward.  This,
        coupled with addition above, means you'll need to have to traverse your
        list in both directions (either doubly-linked or just reverse it as
        needed).  <em>Note:</em> do not rely upon the recursion to be able to do
        the reversing for you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Error conditions</h3>
<p>
    Check to see if <tt>malloc()</tt> fails.  If it does, print a message and
    immediately exit with a non-zero value.  (e.g., <tt>EXIT_FAILURE</tt> from
    <tt>exit(3)</tt> or something from the <tt>sysexits(3)</tt> group if you'd
    prefer)
</p>

<h3>Output matching</h3>
<p>
    As there is very little output specified, I'm going to require that you
    match the sample output exactly.
</p>

<h3>Keep your memory clean and tidy</h3>
<p>
    To keep you thinking about your memory management, I want you to clean up
    <em>all</em> memory that you dynamically allocated before the end of the
    program.  That means that you should be able to run under <tt>valgrind</tt>
    with no memory leaks reported.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>
    I've provided a program called <tt>gen_nums</tt> that will generate random
    positive integer sequences for you.  It is located in
    <tt>~rhoyle/pub/cs241/hw07/</tt> as well.  It requires 2 parameters with
    an optional third.  They are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>A positive integer indicating the max # of digits in each number</li>
    <li>A positive integer indicating the number of numbers to be generated</li>
    <li>An optional positive integer to be used as a random number seed.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    I'm using the C pseudo-random number generator so that you should get
    identical sequences of numbers for the same input parameters.  You can vary
    the seed to get different sequences if desired.
</p>

<pre class="boxed">
% <span class="typed">./gen_nums 10 3 1</span> 
6753
629127
9
% <span class="typed">./gen_nums 10 4 1</span> 
6753
629127
9
6062
% <span class="typed">./gen_nums 10 4 2</span> 
9

</pre>


<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
<p>
  Handle multiplication as well as addition.
</p>

<h3>README</h3>
<p>
    Create a file called <tt>README</tt> that contains
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your name and a description of the programs</li>
    <li>A listing of the files with a short one line description of the contents</li>
    <li>Any known bugs (including valgrind warnings) or incomplete functions</li>
    <li>An estimate of the amount of time you spent completing this assignment</li>
    <li>Any interesting design decisions you'd like to share</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now you should <tt>make clean</tt> to get rid of your executables and
    handin your folder containing your source files, Makefile, and README. 
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
    Here is what I am looking for in this assignment:
</p>
<ul class="padded">
    <li>A working Makefile with your program, all, and clean as targets</li>

    <li>A program that will add up any length of positive integers, ending after
        receiving an EOF</li>

    <li>An internal linked-list representation using structs</li>

    <li>Output matching the sample program</li>

    <li>Appropriately modular code</li>
    
    <li>Good comments</li>

    <li>Runs under valgrind with no errors or warnings</li>

    <li>A README with the information requested above.  The listing of known
    bugs is important.</li>

</ul>
