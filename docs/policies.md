# Course Policy

## Grading

<p>
    Course grades will be calculated based on the following distribution:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>45%</b> - Homework/Labs</li>
    <li><b>15%</b> - Midterm exam</li>
    <li><b>20%</b> - Final exam (not optional)</li>
    <li><b>10%</b> - Participation</li>
    <li><b>10%</b> - Reading Quizzes (on Blackboard and Zybooks)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The distribution might be adjusted based on the progression of the course.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
    Programming projects will generally consist of two major components:
    <ol>
            <li>An underlying data structure implementation</li>
            <li>An application of this data structure</li>
    </ol>
    The actual breakdown of points will depend on the individual project, but
    the plurality of points will be for the data structure implementation.
    Projects will also be graded on style, documentation, and test cases.
</p>
<p>
    If a portion of your program is not working correctly, please clearly
    indicate it in the comments at the beginning of the file and in the
    methods that are not working.  Problems that I discover are graded more
    severely than those you discover.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
    Programming assignments will be graded on both correctness as well
    as programming style.  Good programming style includes the
    following:
    <ul>
	<li>A descriptive header for each file including author's name
        and the date e.g.,
<pre class="boxed code">
/**
 * A demonstration header used for the class syllabus.  Additional lines
 * give additional information in JavaDoc.
 *
 * @author Roberto Hoyle
 * Spring 2012
 */</pre></li>
	<li>Descriptive and meaningful variable and method names</li>
	<li>Logical organization</li>
	<li>Sufficient comments, but not overly commented</li>
	<li>Appropriate use of white space to separate sections</li>
	<li>Consistent indentation and style</li>
    </ul>
    More information on Java style can be found on Sun's <A
    href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html">Code Conventions</a>
    web page.  There is also an open source tool <A
    href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">checkstyle</a> that can
    be used to check the style used.
</p>

## Attendance
<p>
    Regular class and lab attendance and participation is expected.  Please talk
    to me if regular class attendance is going to be a problem.
</p>

## Homework Assignments
<p>
    There will be a number of assignments made in this class.  I expect every
    student to attempt each assignment and turn in the results.  You are
    encouraged to complete every assignment as this is one of the most
    effective ways to learn the material.
</p>
<p>
    If you know that for some reason you will not be able to submit the
    assignment before the deadline, you should contact me in advance of the
    deadline.  Extensions are only granted in exceptional circumstances, but
    need to be done in advance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Late submissions of lab assignments will be penalized up to 50% per day
after the deadline.  No late prelabs will be accepted.</strong>   
You will be allowed 1 late day in each half of the semester and 1 late day that
can be used whenever (total of 4).  You <em>must</em> include the fact that you
are using one of your late days in the README document for an assignment.
</p>
<p>
    
</p>

## Accommodations for students with disabilities
<p>
If you have a <a href="http://new.oberlin.edu/office/disability-services/">disability
    that might impact your performance in this course, or requires special
    accommodation</a>, please contact me as soon as possible so that
    appropriate arrangements can be made.
Support is available through <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/sas-programs">Student
    Academic Success Programs</a>.
You will need to contact them to get your disability documented before
accommodations can be made.
</p>

## Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty
<p>
    I have very low tolerance for academic dishonesty, and will vigorously
    pursue available remedies for any incidents.   All work in this class is to
    be performed according to the <a href="http://new.oberlin.edu/students/policies/honor-system-charter">Oberlin
    Honor Code</a>. Specifically I expect that:
</p>
* Quizzes and exams will be closed book, closed notes, and <b>no</b>
communication between students.  This includes discussing the same
to students who are taking a quiz/exam at another time.
* Discussion of assignments is expected and encouraged, however all
work and code on assignments should be your own without outside
assistance.
* Sources should be cited including the textbook and other web sites
when you use them in your work.
* You are not permitted to share your source code with other
students, including future ones.
* You are not permitted to use other students solutions as your own
(even those from a prior semester), nor answer keys, nor instructor
versions.

<p>
    Illustrative examples:
</p>

* Confirming that we had and exam is <b>OK</b>, telling another
student in the class who has not taken it that it was easy/hard,
what topics, etc. is <b>NOT OK</b>.
* On a project or homework, discussing what needs to be done and how
it can be done is <b>OK</b>, having a student (other than a TA) go
over your code is <b>NOT OK</b>, discussing what might be wrong and
how to tell is <b>OK</b> (and encouraged).
* Other than your partner on a given assignment, it is <b>NOT OK</b>
to give a student a copy of your code or for them to give you a copy
of theirs.  As a rule of thumb when discussing the assignments, you
should not be writing finished solutions out, and you should be able
to independently recreate the material on your own.
* On an assignment, you base your design off of the textbook's
example.  This is <b>OK</b> if you cite the source in the code.
You don't need to have it be part of the Javadoc.
E.g.,
	/* based on insertion sort from Weiss 3rd Ed, p. 306 */</pre>

<p>
    All assignments must include the following signed statement:
</p>
    "I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment."

Electronic submissions should include the honor statement in either the
README file or header comments and must include your name.

## Grader and Tutors
<p>
Contact me if you are interested in a Student Academic Services approved tutor.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~csmc/">CSMC</a> might hold walk-in tutoring sessions as well.
</p>

<p>
    The CS department will be hiring a couple of students to work as lab
    helpers.  They will be in the upstairs lab during the hours posted below.
</p>
<p>
    The most up-to-date list can be found <a href="http://occs.cs.oberlin.edu/classes/cs-lab-helper-schedule/">here</a>.
